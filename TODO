This is a list of things that would be nice to add.

Eye-attracting signal when mouse is warped.  Perhaps an expanding red
circle.

Hysteresis, so you have to push against a border for a bit before you
get through.

More general mechanisms.

Communication with RANDR to rejigger setup automatically.

Protected edge regions, for specific environments.  Eg, in GNOME 3 the
left and right bits of the top edge, and the right bit of the bottom
edge, should be protected against wrapping.

Currently this program waits for the mouse to be at a particular
position and then warps it.  Would be better if it could see the mouse
being pushed through an edge and stopped by the usual X mechanisms,
and take over from there.  This would involve listening to both
position and mouse device movement events I suppose, instead of just
position change events.
